# recommending-engine

Expectation
---

1. Based on viewed movies, the system should recommend unwatched movies to the user
2. Backend should use MovieLens for recommendation
3. Backend should use Janusgraph to store data (Janusgraph is an opensource graph database)
4. Backend should provide different strategy for recommendation

Note: This is initial expectation and I can add more in future.

Thank you, for visiting and don't forget to come back. 

I'm working on it and this will be completed soon!
